# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
This is my Code Louisville Front End Web Developer Final Project. This has been tested on Mac, PC, iPhone, and most modern Android devices and is responsive to a variety of different size screens and viewports. I also used the Chrome Developer Tools to test it on several different devices. Images and text adjust to the browser size. It works on Safari and Chrome by simply launching the index file. 

This website is a work in progress, and will be updated with content and working links. Many of the links do work, but there are a few that I still need to designate a path to.

## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. Main Header( .main-header )
The Main Header adds padding, a background color, and an image uploaded to the server. 


2. Primary Content ( .primary-content )
This includes the attributes of the header and footer, as well as centering the text of those)

3. Callout ( .callout)
This is an element of my webpage that encourages those viewing to interact with the site with CTAs. Also adds borders, padding, margins, and in-line block. 
```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript function I created was:

1. An Alert Button which prompts those visiting this website to click "OK" in order to proceed. Also serves as a welcome message.
